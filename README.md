# Simple RGB Guessing Game  
Simple guessing game using frontend basics, i.e. html, css and javascript.  

## Difficulty and Rules
There are two difficulty modes in the game: 'Easy' and 'Hard'. The only difference between both is the amount of squares shown on the screen. Basically what happens is that easy mode will show you three squares an hard mode will show you six. At the moment there's no amount of tries, so you could pick all the wrong squares and then pick the right one, thus winning the game. Have fun.
